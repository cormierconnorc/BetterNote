TODO List:
1. Set up local note creation/deletion and notebook renaming.
2. Resume previous position on note update
--Complete
3. Add save and sync buttons (or perhaps menu options)
4. Multithreaded synchronization (handle through synchronizeAsync method)
5. Sort notebooks and notes
6. Notebook drag and drop stack creation
--Mostly implemented, just needs to signal database.
--Relocate onModelCreateStack signal to a point where widgets are fully realized.
